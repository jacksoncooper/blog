By default, Jekyll uses the [`kramdown`](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) Markdown renderer and its [`parser-gfm`](https://github.com/kramdown/parser-gfm) parser. `gfm` here means GitHub Flavored Markdown.

[`rogue`](http://rouge.jneen.net/) is used for syntax highlighting. Here's some pretty Rust.

```js
fn print_hello(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {}.", name);
}

fn main() {
    print_hello("Elizabeth");
}
```

`kramdown` supports $$ \LaTeX $$ if you have something to render it with!

$$
\begin{aligned}
  1 + \sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} 2 ^ i
    &= 1 + \left( 1 + 2 + \dots + 2 ^ {n - 1} \right) \\
    &= 1 + (2 ^ n - 1) \\
    &= 2 ^ n
\end{aligned}
$$

I'm using [`MathJax`](https://www.mathjax.org/). Note that `kramdown`'s delimeters for display and inline math are both `$$`. The former must appear on [block boundaries](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#block-boundaries).

I [overrode](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults) the [`post.html`](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/_layouts/post.html) file in Jekyll's default theme [`minima`](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and included `MathJax` using [these](https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted) scripts. This isn't an ideal solution, because my custom `post.html` will shadow any updates to the corresponding file in the theme's [gem](https://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/). I also included the following HTML to make sure MathJax doesn't overflow its container, but I probably shouldn't be styling MathJax's internal classes. I'm not sure if there's a way to accomplish this using MathJax's [configuration object](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/options/index.html).

```html
<style> mjx-container { overflow-x: auto; } </style>
```
