I'm reading through the third edition of _Eloquent JavaScript_ by [Marijn Haverbeke](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/). Formula 4.1 in Chapter 4 '_Data Structures: Objects and Arrays_' kind of comes out of nowhere, and I wanted to see if I could figure out why it works. If other readers find this, I'm curious if you found a derivation that's less convoluted than the one that follows.

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \phi = \frac{n_{11} n_{00} - n_{10} n_{01}}{\sqrt{n_{1 \bullet} n_{0 \bullet} n_{\bullet 1} n_{\bullet 0}}}
\end{equation*}
$$

We watch Jacques one day, waiting for Jacques to perform an activity like 'touched tree.' Define two Bernoulli random variables $$ S $$ and $$ A $$. $$ S $$ records if Jacques transforms into a squirrel, and $$ A $$ records if Jacques performs the activity of interest. The two random variables are not independent. Jacques may be more likely to transform into a squirrel if they touch a tree. Next, we can mechanically apply formulas from the class we took on introductory probability.

$$
\begin{align*}
  E(S) &= p_{10} + p_{11} \\
  \text{Var}(S) &= (p_{10} + p_{11})(1 - p_{10} - p_{11}) \\
  E(A) &= p_{01} + p_{11} \\
  \text{Var}(A) &= (p_{01} + p_{11})(1 - p_{01} - p_{11})
\end{align*}
$$

The little p's come from the probability mass function of the random vector $$ (S, A) $$. The first subscript is a 1 in the event that Jacques turns into a squirrel, and the second subscript is a 1 in the event that Jacques performs the given activity.

Then,

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \text{Cov}(S, A) = E[SA] - E(S)E(A) = p_{11} - (p_{10} + p_{11})(p_{01} + p_{11})
\end{equation*}
$$

The expected value of the random variable $$ SA $$ is easy, because it is a new Bernoulli variable that is 1 only in the event that Jacques does the activity and turns into a squirrel.

With all these pieces,

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \text{Corr}(S, A) = \frac{p_{11} - (p_{10} + p_{11})(p_{01} + p_{11})}{\sqrt{(p_{10} + p_{11})(1 - p_{10} - p_{11})}\sqrt{(p_{01} + p_{11})(1 - p_{01} - p_{11})}}
\end{equation*}
$$

If we watch Jacques over $$ n $$ days,

$$ p_{sa} = \frac{n_{sa}}{n} = \frac{n_{sa}}{n_{11} + n_{00} + n_{10} + n_{01} } $$

The little n's are just the number of times we observe the particular outcome associated with the given probability over $$ n $$ days. If we substitute those equations into the equation for $$ \text{Corr}(S, A) $$ and ask Mathematica to simplify the horror that results we get

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \phi = \frac{n_{11} n_{00} - n_{10} n_{01}}{\sqrt{(n_{11} + n_{10}) (n_{00} + n_{01}) (n_{11} + n_{01}) (n_{00} + n_{10})}}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is what we wanted.
